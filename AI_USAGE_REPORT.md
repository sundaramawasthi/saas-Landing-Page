1. Overview
This report outlines the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the development of the project, emphasizing
that while AI was a valuable tool, the majority of work was performed manually by the development team.

3. AI Contribution
Percentage: Approximately 20% of the project work involved AI assistance.

Scope: AI was mainly used for:

Generating initial code snippets and boilerplate.

Providing UI/UX design suggestions.

Assisting with debugging and code optimization.



3. Manual Contribution
Percentage: Around 80% of the development was manual effort.

Scope: Manual work included:

Custom architecture design and overall project planning.

Integrating and adapting AI-generated code to fit specific requirements.

Writing  logic and handling edge cases.

Thorough testing, validation, and performance tuning.

Finalizing UI design and branding elements.


4. Benefits of AI Assistance
Accelerated development time by reducing boilerplate coding.

Provided creative ideas and alternative solutions.

Helped identify bugs and potential improvements faster.

5. Importance of Human Oversight
Ensured AI outputs matched project goals and quality standards.

Adapted AI-generated code for optimal performance and maintainability.

Applied critical thinking and domain expertise not replicable by AI.

6. Conclusion
The project successfully leveraged AI as a supportive tool without
compromising human creativity and quality control. This balanced approach
 maximized efficiency while ensuring robustness, resulting in a high-quality product.
